\abstract{This report will cover issues I faced in the first semester of year two and will propose some SMART solutions that may help resolve these issues.}

%Relevance and Importance (to games industry)

%How the skills affects my work

%Propose a solution to this problem in referenace to SMART

%Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
%Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
%Assignable – specify who will do it.
%Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
%Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

\section{Key skill One}
\subsection{Communication in a large team}

%Importance
Working and communicating well in a large team is critical when working in a business. Furthermore this skill is very relevant to the games industry because as a programmer I will have to communicate well across different disciplines, such as Design, Art etc..

%How it affects my work
This issues affected the quality of my Comp230 collaborative project as I had to work with a large team of 12 people. I had to communicate with the programmers and designers on that team to understand what functionality they wanted for the networking component. However the communication that I had wasn't all that regular, especially towards the end of the semester because I had so much other work to be doing along side this project.


%Solution
\subsection{How I aim to overcome this problem}
Over the course of next semester when I will continue development of the lobby system, I will aim to fix this by dedicating one or possibly two days a week to be in their studio and work along side the programmers to get more of an understanding about what to do for the component.







\section{Key skill Two}
\subsection{Distributing workload evenly}
%Importance
When having a lot of projects to work on simultaneously, it is sometimes hard to distribute the work out evenly so each project gets the same amount of time, and one project doesn't get put off till the last minute. 

%How it affects my work
This affected my work a lot this year because there were some projects that I favored a lot over some of the others, thus I spent more of my time to a project that was going well, instead of spending time on the projects that weren't going so well.

%Solution
\subsection{How I aim to overcome this problem}
To try and overcome this issue I will propose a working routine for next semester, where I can only work on one of the projects in a specified day. For example, work on one project from Mon-Tues and another from Wed-Thu. This will allow for even distribution of projects and force me to work on projects that I may not enjoy as much, but that need to get done.


\section{Key skill Three}
\subsection{Confidence}

%Importance
Confidence is important throughout life in general, however having confidence in the games industry will mean you can get further and be more successful. By communicating with colleagues easier.


%How this affects my work

\section{Key skill Four}
\subsection{Community engagement}

%Importance
Engaging with the community, whether that community is the audience for you game, or your programmer colleagues, such as peer reviewing code.


%How this affects my work
I felt I have not done much of a community engagement this semester.
Next semester I will plan on having more of a presence on github, and make comments on my peers code.
