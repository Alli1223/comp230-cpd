# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Monday was a catch up session that I went over this years course materials.

###Problems that I encountered this week: Coming up for an idea for the COMP230-Pre-production was difficult because the BA team that I am working with have not come up with a game project yet, so it's hard to choose a component for a game, when I don't know what the game is.

Thursday we went over the graphics pipeline, which I was already kind of familiar with as Computerphile went over this topic in a few of their videos.

I did manage to draw a triangle using openGL in the lesson aswell which was satisfying, although I still need to familiar myself with a lot of what the code actually does.


###How I aim to overcome these issues:

I will have more input into the BA game next week, so I can get a rough Idea of what to work on, such as a VR project or an multiplayer aspect, or an PCG or AR element.


## Week Two
Monday we went over our proposals which I still need to work on a lot more over the coming week.

Thursday we covered the graphics pipeline in more depth and made the triangle change colour. I also proposed my graphics and simulation idea which was overscoped and needs to be refined to be more achievable.

Friday we covered how humans interact with stuff.

###Problems I encountered this week:
* Keeping up with the Comp 220 live coding sessions

###How I aim to overcome these issues
Review the comp 220 live coding sessions at home and see what ED did that I missed so I can change the size of the triangle.

##Week Three
Made triangles move about within SDL/openGL and I feel like I know how to move forward with this to make my simulation project work.

###Problems That I encountered this week
Missed two lectures this week and have to try and catch up on missed material.

###How I aim to overcome these issues
I will have a tutor meeting to make sure I have understood the missed material about beamer and other things I missed in the lecture.

##Week four

Discussed Ethics and Stereotypes which will help me for my ethics essay.
Made cube in openGL

Presented our findings on the interface evaluation

###Problems I encountered this week
The presentation was not very fleshed out because I had not integrated my survey results into the website. Furthermore the website was fairly bland as I spent too much time designing the website instead of actually filling it out with information.

###How I aim to overcome these problems:
I will spend the weekend working on the Interfaces and Interaction website to fill out most of the information I realized I missed.


##Week Five
Sprint Review of comp 230
Met up with BA team on Wednesday to organize my component. I chose to do a networking component because that is what they needed for their game, and I have a little bit of knowledge with unity networking.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Sprint review didn't happen because lecturer was ill.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:


## Week Six
Worked on the graphics task for the start of the week and presented it on Thursday.
Friday I had a viva on the interface and interaction website.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Struggling with essay topic

###How I aim to overcome these issues:


##Week Seven
Monday I presented findings on my ethics essay. Still need to revise my questions to be more ethical, because at the moment it is very board and doesn't represent a specific ethical question.

Wednesday I spent at the penryn campus with the second years adding the networking component to their game.

###Issues I encountered this week:
* Presenting the ethics essay question went badly because the question is too broad, and I fear having a very specific ethical question about crowdfunding will have very little scholarly work done about it that I can reference.

* There is also a lot of unity specific stuff that I need to learn in order to start integrating the networking component, because unity has it's own networking High Level API.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
 Look at more papers about crowdfunding and see if I can find some ethical questions that have been addressed in other papers that I can reference.

Look deeply into the unity networking documentation and start implementing a lobby scene that I can work on.

##Week Eight
Was ill on Mondays sprint review, so have booked a tutor session with Mike to go over the material that I missed.

spent Tuesday in the BA's 2nd year room again and managed to get a lobby scene working, based of Unitys template. I will continue working on this to fix some of the bugs it has created.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Missed sprint review

Bugs in unity networking.

Multiple programmers trying to implement the same thing in different ways. For example one of the BA programmers has created a spawn script that tries to spawn players when the game starts. However this does not work when the game starts from the lobby scene.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will talk to the BA designers and programmers later this week about how they want the game to start.
Went over sprint in tutor meeting.



##Week Nine
Worked on graphics task and essay on Monday and Tuesday. Fixed lighting issues in graphics and sim project.

Worked on Graphics Research Journal and Pre-Production on Wednesday


###Problems I encountered this week:
Still having issues with the essay topic and what to write about.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
Have a talk with one of the lecturers about what direction I could take with the essay.




##Week Ten
Spent Monday reviewing others ethics essay, however mine is still a very rough draft which needs a lot more work done.

Spent most of the rest of this week going over the Research Journals which are due the following week, this meant reading and trying to understand a lot of academic papers. I also worked more on my Comp220 portfolio piece.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Trying to get my self motivated to work on writing essays and research journals instead of programming.

Understanding some of the more complicated academic papers.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and do the academic writing early in the morning before I do any programming, that way I will not get caught up in programming and forget to start doing my writing.



##Week Eleven
Handed in Research Journals and Ethics essay. I felt the AR/VR research journal was very rushed.
Deadlines for Comp210, Comp220 and Comp 230 are next Monday and I still have a lot to get done for the Comp210.

I'm feeling very unmotivated for the comp210 AR project as it is almost the deadline and I have not used the vive yet, and the Arduino that we were suppose to be integrating to our project have not arrived either, this means that I am not sure how to go about starting this project as I don't know the way in which I will be able to get the position of the vive controllers in unity.

The last two weeks have been very stressful, as there have been a lot of deadlines and late nights catching up with work.


###Problems I encountered this week:
Going to be honest, time management wasn't great. Had a lot of sleepless nights trying to finish work as all these deadlines creeped up very fast.

Lack of motivation for some projects.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and not leave things that I assume to be easy till the end, and next semester will try and get them done before I start work on the tasks I assume will be more difficult.




##Week Twelve
Handed in all assignment, I'm quite happy with how the Comp220 project came along, however the Comp210 was a bit tragic, and the Comp230 was alright, but working with a BA team that has two programmers can be difficult as they have been taught differently to us, and in a different programming language.

Presented the work that I have been doing for the Comp230 networking component to the rest of my course, including the first years. I am a very bad public speaker and I found this to be very nerve-racking as I was presenting all by myself. However it felt good after I had done it.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Only focusing on one project mainly per week, when I should of been spreading my time between projects more evenly.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
Next semester I will try to organize my week more efficiently so I can only work on some projects in different times of the week. For example only work on one project from days Mon-Tue and another from Wed-Thu etc..

Issue1: Not prioritizing work that I prefer.
Issue2: Communicating with a large team better.
