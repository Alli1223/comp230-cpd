# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Monday was a catch up session that I went over this years course materials.

###Problems that I encountered this week: Coming up for an idea for the COMP230-Pre-production was difficult because the BA team that I am working with have not come up with a game project yet, so it's hard to choose a component for a game, when I don't know what the game is.

Thursday we went over the graphics pipeline, which I was already kind of familiar with as Computerphile went over this topic in a few of their videos.

I did manage to draw a triangle using openGL in the lesson aswell which was satisfying, although I still need to familiar myself with a lot of what the code actually does.


###How I aim to overcome these issues:

I will have more input into the BA game next week, so I can get a rough Idea of what to work on, such as a VR project or an multiplayer aspect, or an PCG or AR element.


## Week Two
Monday we went over our proposals which I still need to work on a lot more over the coming week.

Thursday we covered the graphics pipeline in more depth and made the triangle change colour. I also proposed my graphics and simulation idea which was overscoped and needs to be refined to be more achievable.

Friday we covered how humans interact with stuff.

###Problems I encountered this week:
* Keeping up with the Comp 220 live coding sessions

###How I aim to overcome these issues
Review the comp 220 live coding sessions at home and see what ED did that I missed so I can change the size of the triangle.

##Week Three
Made triangles move about within SDL/openGL and I feel like I know how to move forward with this to make my simulation project work.

###Problems That I encountered this week
Missed two lectures this week and have to try and catch up on missed material.

###How I aim to overcome these issues
I will have a tutor meeting to make sure I have understood the missed material about beamer and other things I missed in the lecture.

##Week four

Discussed Ethics and Stereotypes which will help me for my ethics essay.
Made cube in openGL

Presented our findings on the interface evaluation

###Problems I encountered this week
The presentation was not very fleshed out because I had not integrated my survey results into the website. Furthermore the website was fairly bland as I spent too much time designing the website instead of actually filling it out with information.

###How I aim to overcome these problems:
I will spend the weekend working on the Interfaces and Interaction website to fill out most of the information I realized I missed.


##Week Five
Sprint Review of comp 230
Met up with BA team on Wednesday to organize my component. I chose to do a networking component because that is what they needed for their game, and I have a little bit of knowledge with unity networking.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Sprint review didn't happen because lecturer was ill.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:


## Week Six
Worked on the graphics task for the start of the week and presented it on Thursday.
Friday I had a viva on the interface and interaction website.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Struggling with essay topic

###How I aim to overcome these issues:


##Week Seven
Monday I presented findings on my ethics essay. Still need to revise my questions to be more etical, because at the moment it is very board and doesn't represent a specific ethical question.

Wednesday I spent at the penryn campus with the second years adding the networking component to their game.

###Issues I encountered this week:
* Presenting the ethics essay question went badly because the question is too broad, and I fear having a very specific ethical question about crowdfunding will have very little scholarly work done about it that I can reference.

* There is also a lot of unity specifc stuff that I need to learn in order to start intergrating the networking component, because unity has it's own networking High Level API.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
 Look at more papers about crowdfunding and see if I can find some ethical questions that have been addressed in other papers that I can reference.

Look deeply into the unity networking documentation and start implementing a lobby scene that I can work on.

##Week Eight
Was ill on Mondays sprint review, so have booked a tutor session with Mike to go over the material that I missed.

spent Tuesday in the BA's 2nd year room again and managed to get a lobby scene working, based of unitys template. I will continue working on this to fix some of the bugs it has created.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Missed sprint review

Bugs in unity networking.

Multiple programmers trying to implement the same thing in different ways. For example one of the BA programmers has created a spawn script that tries to spawn players when the game starts. However this does not work when the game starts from the lobby scene.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will talk to the BA designers and programmers later this week about how they want the game to start.
Went over sprint in tutor meeting.

##Week Nine
Worked on graphics task and essay on Monday and Tuesday. Fixed lighting issues in graphics and sim project.

Worked on Graphics Research Journal and Pre-Production on Wednesday


###Problems I encountered this week:
Still having issues with the essay topic and what to write about.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
