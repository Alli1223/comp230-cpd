# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Monday was a catch up session that I went over this years course materials.

###Problems that I encountered this week: Coming up for an idea for the COMP230-Pre-production was difficult because the BA team that I am working with have not come up with a game project yet, so it's hard to choose a component for a game, when I don't know what the game is.

Thursday we went over the graphics pipeline, which I was already kind of familiar with as Computerphile went over this topic in a few of their videos.

I did manage to draw a triangle using openGL in the lesson aswell which was satisfying, although I still need to familiar myself with a lot of what the code actually does.


###How I aim to overcome these issues:

I will have more input into the BA game next week, so I can get a rough Idea of what to work on, such as a VR project or an multiplayer aspect, or an PCG or AR element.


## Week Two
Monday we went over our proposals which I still need to work on a lot more over the coming week.

Thursday we covered the graphics pipeline in more depth and made the triangle change colour. I also proposed my graphics and simulation idea which was overscoped and needs to be refined to be more achievable.

Friday we covered how humans interact with stuff.

###Problems I encountered this week:
* Keeping up with the Comp 220 live coding sessions

###How I aim to overcome these issues
Review the comp 220 live coding sessions at home and see what ED did that I missed so I can change the size of the triangle.

##Week Three
Made triangles move about within SDL/openGL and I feel like I know how to move forward with this to make my simulation project work.

###Problems That I encountered this week
Missed two lectures this week and have to try and catch up on missed material.

###How I aim to overcome these issues
I will have a tutor meeting to make sure I have understood the missed material about beamer and other things I missed in the lecture.

##Week four

Discussed Ethics and Stereotypes which will help me for my ethics essay.
Made cube in openGL

Presented our findings on the interface evaluation

###Problems I encountered this week
The presentation was not very fleshed out because I had not integrated my survey results into the website. Furthermore the website was fairly bland as I spent too much time designing the website instead of actually filling it out with information.

###How I aim to overcome these problems:
I will spend the weekend working on the Interfaces and Interaction website to fill out most of the information I realized I missed.
