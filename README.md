# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Monday was a catch up session that I went over this years course materials.

###Problems that I encountered this week: Coming up for an idea for the COMP230-Pre-production was difficult because the BA team that I am working with have not come up with a game project yet, so it's hard to choose a component for a game, when I don't know what the game is.

Thursday we went over the graphics pipeline, which I was already kind of familiar with as Computerphile went over this topic in a few of their videos.

I did manage to draw a triangle using openGL in the lesson aswell which was satisfying, although I still need to familiar myself with a lot of what the code actually does.


###How I aim to overcome these issues:

I will have more input into the BA game next week, so I can get a rough Idea of what to work on, such as a VR project or an multiplayer aspect, or an PCG or AR element.

## Week Two
Monday we went over our proposals which I still need to work on a lot more
