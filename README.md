#Summary

##Career Goals
This first semester has been rather enjoyable, and I have learnt a load of new stuff since last year.
For my career goals after this course I'm still not sure what I would like to do, either be a part of a small Indie team or work for a company. 

##Progress towards these goals
The comp220 portfolio project has made me motivated to start my own game project in C++ as I have really enjoyed knowing how the low level game engine components work. I have also bee inspired by the game Cube World which is very similar to what I have been creating in the comp220 project.

Having tried the vive out at the end of this semester, I  realized how easy it was to integrate the vive into Unity, and how easy it would be to create a fun simple vive game in it. If I had better access to a vive I would like to start playing around more with what is possible to do in unity to create a fun VR experience.

Working with a large BA team of 12 people, of which 3 are programmers has been overall a fun experience and has motivated me to be a part of a small indie team.



##Working with a large BA team
Working with the BA Digital Game team only part-time has been challenging because I have to catch up with all the work they've been doing over a week or so of having no communication. Further more their team did not have any source control for their project, so I only got an updated build of their game by going to their studio space and requesting a new build.
This also has the issue of me having to go over their code and work out what they have changed in the last week and work around that.

###SMART solution:
To overcome this issue, over the course of the next semester I will create a source control repository for all the programmers in the team and help teach them how to use source control, so they can upload their new scripts to the repo, then I can see what they've changed and work on top of that. I will measure this by how much they update the code in the repository.



##Distributing work evenly throughout each week
For some weeks this semester I would only focus on one of the 3 assignments, i.e. Only working on comp220 or 230 and not working on comp210. 

###SMART solution:
Next semester I will try to organize my week more efficiently so I can only work on some projects in different times of the week. For example only work on one project from days Mon-Tue and another from Wed-Thu etc.. 

##Using source control collaboratively.
This semester I have only used source control for my own projects, and have not used it for any collaborative repos. This means that even though I have become more confident in using source control, I have not practiced fixing merge conflicts in a long time.

###SMART solution:
Next semester I will try and set up a collaborative repository where I can work with other students together to increase my knowledge of fixing the source control related issues that come with collaborative repos. I will measure this by my ability to fix source control conflicts next semester.

##Learning other programming languages
Throughout this semester I have been trying to understand the C# language that is integrated with Unity. This has been fairly challenging as the way C# in Untiy works is very different to how C++ in OpenGL and SDL work. Furthermore next semester I will have to learn Java on top of this.

###SMART solution:
Over the Christmas holidays I plan on playing around with the Java programming language. I will try and program some basic functionality to an existing open source java game. This will allow me to have  a head start when we start doing Java programming next semester.

## Becoming more familiar with C++
There are still some key features that I do not yet understand about the C++ language, for example I still can not program pointers into my project and I have not taken advantage of using inheritance in my project also.

###SMART solution:
Over the Christmas break I will continue development of my OpenGL project and will try to optimize the code by learning and implementing points into my program. I will measure this by my commits to github and progress of learning new C++ features.







# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Monday was a catch up session that I went over this years course materials.

###Problems that I encountered this week: Coming up for an idea for the COMP230-Pre-production was difficult because the BA team that I am working with have not come up with a game project yet, so it's hard to choose a component for a game, when I don't know what the game is.

Thursday we went over the graphics pipeline, which I was already kind of familiar with as Computerphile went over this topic in a few of their videos.

I did manage to draw a triangle using openGL in the lesson as-well which was satisfying, although I still need to familiar myself with a lot of what the code actually does.


###How I aim to overcome these issues:

I will have more input into the BA game next week, so I can get a rough Idea of what to work on, such as a VR project or an multiplayer aspect, or an PCG or AR element.


## Week Two
Monday we went over our proposals which I still need to work on a lot more over the coming week.

Thursday we covered the graphics pipeline in more depth and made the triangle change colour. I also proposed my graphics and simulation idea which was overscoped and needs to be refined to be more achievable.

Friday we covered how humans interact with stuff.

###Problems I encountered this week:
* Keeping up with the Comp 220 live coding sessions

###How I aim to overcome these issues
Review the comp 220 live coding sessions at home and see what ED did that I missed so I can change the size of the triangle.

##Week Three
Made triangles move about within SDL/openGL and I feel like I know how to move forward with this to make my simulation project work.

###Problems That I encountered this week
Missed two lectures this week and have to try and catch up on missed material.

###How I aim to overcome these issues
I will have a tutor meeting to make sure I have understood the missed material about beamer and other things I missed in the lecture.

##Week four

Discussed Ethics and Stereotypes which will help me for my ethics essay.
Made cube in openGL

Presented our findings on the interface evaluation

###Problems I encountered this week
The presentation was not very fleshed out because I had not integrated my survey results into the website. Furthermore the website was fairly bland as I spent too much time designing the website instead of actually filling it out with information.

###How I aim to overcome these problems:
I will spend the weekend working on the Interfaces and Interaction website to fill out most of the information I realized I missed.


##Week Five
Sprint Review of comp 230
Met up with BA team on Wednesday to organize my component. I chose to do a networking component because that is what they needed for their game, and I have a little bit of knowledge with unity networking.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Sprint review didn't happen.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will document what progress I have done this sprint to present to a lecturer later on.

## Week Six
Worked on the graphics task for the start of the week and presented it on Thursday.
Friday I had a viva on the interface and interaction website.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Struggling to find an easy place to start with the unity networking.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will go through the Unity networking tutorials later in the week to try and understand how to go about implementing it.


##Week Seven
Monday I presented findings on my ethics essay. Still need to revise my questions to be more ethical, because at the moment it is very board and doesn't represent a specific ethical question.

Wednesday I spent at the Penryn campus with the second years adding the networking component to their game.

###Issues I encountered this week:
* Presenting the ethics essay question went badly because the question is too broad, and I fear having a very specific ethical question about crowdfunding will have very little scholarly work done about it that I can reference.

* There is also a lot of unity specific stuff that I need to learn in order to start integrating the networking component, because unity has it's own networking High Level API.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
 Look at more papers about crowdfunding and see if I can find some ethical questions that have been addressed in other papers that I can reference.

Look deeply into the unity networking documentation and start implementing a lobby scene that I can work on.

##Week Eight
Was ill on Mondays sprint review, so have booked a tutor session with Mike to go over the material that I missed.

spent Tuesday in the BA's 2nd year room again and managed to get a lobby scene working, based of Unitys template. I will continue working on this to fix some of the bugs it has created.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Missed sprint review

Bugs in unity networking.

Multiple programmers trying to implement the same thing in different ways. For example one of the BA programmers has created a spawn script that tries to spawn players when the game starts. However this does not work when the game starts from the lobby scene.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will talk to the BA designers and programmers later this week about how they want the game to start.
Went over sprint in tutor meeting.



##Week Nine
Worked on graphics task and essay on Monday and Tuesday. Fixed lighting issues in graphics and sim project.

Worked on Graphics Research Journal and Pre-Production on Wednesday


###Problems I encountered this week:
Still having issues with the essay topic and what to write about.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
Have a talk with one of the lecturers about what direction I could take with the essay.




##Week Ten
Spent Monday reviewing others ethics essay, however mine is still a very rough draft which needs a lot more work done.

Spent most of the rest of this week going over the Research Journals which are due the following week, this meant reading and trying to understand a lot of academic papers. I also worked more on my Comp220 portfolio piece.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Trying to get my self motivated to work on writing essays and research journals instead of programming.

Understanding some of the more complicated academic papers.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and do the academic writing early in the morning before I do any programming, that way I will not get caught up in programming and forget to start doing my writing.



##Week Eleven
Handed in Research Journals and Ethics essay. I felt the AR/VR research journal was very rushed.
Deadlines for Comp210, Comp220 and Comp 230 are next Monday and I still have a lot to get done for the Comp210.

I'm feeling very unmotivated for the comp210 AR project as it is almost the deadline and I have not used the vive yet, and the Arduino that we were suppose to be integrating to our project have not arrived either, this means that I am not sure how to go about starting this project as I don't know the way in which I will be able to get the position of the vive controllers in unity.

The last two weeks have been very stressful, as there have been a lot of deadlines and late nights catching up with work.


###Problems I encountered this week:
Going to be honest, time management wasn't great. Had a lot of sleepless nights trying to finish work as all these deadlines creeped up very fast.

Lack of motivation for some projects.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and not leave things that I assume to be easy till the end, and next semester will try and get them done before I start work on the tasks I assume will be more difficult.




##Week Twelve
Handed in all assignment, I'm quite happy with how the Comp220 project came along, however the Comp210 was a bit tragic, and the Comp230 was alright, but working with a BA team that has two programmers can be difficult as they have been taught differently to us, and in a different programming language.

Presented the work that I have been doing for the Comp230 networking component to the rest of my course, including the first years. I am a very bad public speaker and I found this to be very nerve-racking as I was presenting all by myself. However it felt good after I had done it.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Only focusing on one project mainly per week, when I should of been spreading my time between projects more evenly.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
Next semester I will try to organize my week more efficiently so I can only work on some projects in different times of the week. For example only work on one project from days Mon-Tue and another from Wed-Thu etc..



#Semester Two

##Week One
This week we came up with an initial design for the comp 260 Distributed systems sever. 
We also covered what AI is, and have started thinking about what to work on for my AI portfolio project.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Getting back into the rhythm of working from the Christmas break.

###How I aim to overcome these issues:
Spend more time in the studio next week.

##Week Two 
Missed Mondays lecture due to health issues. 
Tuesday spent in studio working on comp240-production tasks. & AI lecture.

Problems I encountered this week:
Getting started on the comp240-production is really challenging as i am not too sure where to start, because the game has changed so much over the last few weeks.

How I aim to overcome these issues:
Over the coming week I will go over the changes they have made and try and understand them.

##Week Three 
Monday spent working more on the comp260-server which I have started to work on the database that is needed for the server to store game data.
This has turned out to be quite challenging as setting up SQL and Java within eclipse is actually rather hard to get working, as you need to get JDBC drivers that will connect to the database.
Missed tuesdays lecture. However I have booked a tutor meeting to go over the comp 250 AI proposal that I have come up with.

Problems I encountered this week:
Understanding how to intergrate sql into Java.

How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and find some tutorials over the weekend and try and get a basic SQL database connected to the server by the beginning of next week.
